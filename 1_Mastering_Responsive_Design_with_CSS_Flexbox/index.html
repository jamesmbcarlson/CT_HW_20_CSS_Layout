            <p>Swimming pools have long been a source of relaxation, recreation, and even therapy for people around the world. From ancient ceremonial baths to modern marvels of engineering, these aquatic wonders hold a wealth of fascinating secrets and surprising trivia. Join us as we dive into the depths of the world of swimming pools, uncovering some of the most intriguing and unusual facts that make them more than just a place to take a dip.</p>

        <div class="facts-list">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Oldest Swimming Pool:</b> The oldest known swimming pool is believed to be the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro, Pakistan, dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE. It was likely used for religious or ceremonial purposes.</li>
                <li><b>Largest Swimming Pool:</b> The largest swimming pool by area is the Crystal Lagoon in Algarrobo, Chile. It covers an area of 20 acres and holds 66 million gallons of seawater.</li>
                <li><b>Deepest Swimming Pool:</b> Y-40 "The Deep Joy" in Montegrotto Terme, Italy, holds the record for the deepest swimming pool. It has a depth of 137 feet (42 meters).</li>
                <li><b>Saltwater Pools:</b> Some pools use saltwater instead of chlorine for sanitation. Saltwater pools have lower chlorine levels and are often considered more gentle on the skin and eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Olympic Pools:</b> Olympic swimming pools are standardized to be 50 meters long, 25 meters wide, and at least 2 meters deep. They also have specific lane markings and depths for competition.</li>
                <li><b>Pool Evaporation:</b> On average, a residential swimming pool loses about 1/4 inch of water per day to evaporation. In hotter climates, this rate can be even higher.</li>
                <li><b>Chlorine Smell:</b> The distinctive "chlorine smell" often associated with swimming pools isn't actually from chlorine itself. It's caused by chloramines, which are formed when chlorine reacts with sweat, urine, and other organic matter in the water.</li>
                <li><b>Pool Filtration:</b> The first modern pool filtration system was invented in 1910 by Charles Curtis, a mechanical engineer. His system used a sand filter to remove impurities from the water.</li>
                <li><b>Natural Swimming Pools:</b> Some swimming pools are designed to resemble natural bodies of water, with plants and biofilters instead of traditional chemical treatments. These pools are called natural swimming pools or freshwater pools.</li>
                <li><b>Underwater Music:</b> Some luxury pools feature underwater sound systems, allowing swimmers to listen to music or even hear the sounds of the ocean while underwater.</li>
                <li><b>Pool Floats:</b> The first inflatable pool toy was invented by a Californian named Fred DeLuca in 1957. It was a simple inflatable beach ball, but it paved the way for the wide variety of pool floats available today.</li>
                <li><b>Pool Covers:</b> Pool covers not only help keep debris out of the water but can also reduce evaporation by up to 95%, conserve energy by retaining heat, and prevent chemical loss from sunlight exposure.</li>
                <li><b>Fastest Swim Stroke:</b> The freestyle stroke, often called the front crawl, is the fastest swimming stroke. Top swimmers can reach speeds of over 5 miles per hour (8 kilometers per hour) in short bursts.</li>
                <li><b>Therapeutic Pools:</b> Hydrotherapy pools, often found in rehabilitation centers, use warm water and jets to provide therapeutic benefits for conditions such as arthritis, muscle injuries, and chronic pain.</li>
                <li><b>Pool on a Plane:</b> Some luxurious private jets and airline services offer onboard swimming pools or hot tubs for their passengers to enjoy while flying.</li>
